In this approach, designers must:</p><ul><li>Assess potential vulnerabilities in a system</li><li>Identify types of threats that may occur</li><li>Select technical and managerial controls to protect the system</li></ul><p>This is proactive prevention rather than reactive response to problems.</p>"

Key aspects:</p><ul><li>Privacy is integral to design and architecture of IT systems</li><li>Privacy is integral to business practices</li><li>Not an add-on after design is complete</li></ul><p>Privacy becomes a foundational component.</p>"
